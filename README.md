# Arduino Java Code for a german word clock


!https://github.com/mirohero/germanWordClock/img/img.jpg

I've printed https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2130830 and I didn't find flashable code for the arduino or clones like NodeMCU. So I wrote this simple, synchronized code to flash with the Arduino IDE.



1. Include the external libraries FastLED, ESP8266WiFi.h and TimeClient.h
2. Change SSID, WiFi-password and the number of leds in the java code
3. Flash the code with the arduino IDE
